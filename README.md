# Constructive Dialogue Rules

Version 1.0

## Summary

The _constructive dialogue rules_ mean that comments:

1. must be relevant to the original post or to the specific topic under discussion,
2. must refrain from personal attacks, and
3. should supply evidence or sources for any assertions.

Comments that do not meet the rules are subject to deletion.

The super-short summary: relevance, evidence, civility.

To apply this to a discussion, you might include the following text at the bottom of a post.

    Constructive Dialogue Rules apply: relevance, evidence, civility.
    
You can include a link to here, like https://bit.ly/2W98J8W or https://github.com/sprowell/cdr, but since links are usually trapped and expanded on, say, Facebook, that may not be what you want and probably isn't necessary.

## Details

Too many discussions of controversial topics--even mildly controversial topics--degenerate into yelling which is neither _constructive_ nor _persuasive_.  That is, you aren't contributing and you aren't going to change anyone's mind.  The _constructive dialogue rules_ exist to provide the pretext to eliminate these "dead ends" in a conversation.  Disagreement is welcome; personal attacks, off-topic comments, and assertions without any support are not.

### Be relevant
A comment must address something from the original post or be a follow-up to another comment that satisfies the rules.  If the topic is _global warming_ and you are posting about _socialism_ you might be on topic... but probably aren't.  It is up to the commenter to make the connection sufficiently clear.

### Be polite
You don't have to like everyone, but you must be _polite_.  This means you must refrain from personal attacks, even against people not on the thread.

### Be prepared to provide evidence
You don't have to provide citations for everything you write, but you should be prepared to provide evidence when asked.

## Contributing

Semantic versioning is used here.  This is interpreted as: changes that would not change the disposition of comments increment the minor number.  Breaking changes increment the major number.  See https://semver.org/.
