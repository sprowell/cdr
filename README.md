# Constructive Dialogue Rules

Version 1.1

## Summary

The _constructive dialogue rules_ mean that comments:

1. Find common ground
2. must be relevant to the original post or to the specific topic under discussion,
3. must refrain from personal attacks, and
4. should supply evidence or sources for any assertions.
5. admit when you are arguing from experience
6. strong man an opinion you don't agree with

Comments that do not meet the rules are subject to deletion.

## Details

Too many discussions of controversial topics--even mildly controversial topics--degenerate into yelling which is neither _constructive_ nor _persuasive_.  That is, you aren't contributing and you aren't going to change anyone's mind.  The _constructive dialogue rules_ exist to provide the pretext to eliminate these "dead ends" in a conversation.  Disagreement is welcome; personal attacks, off-topic comments, and assertions without any support are not.

### Find common ground
Too often many disagreements are due to fundemental differences about how the world works.  As a way to avoid this, find something that you can agree on and build from there.

### Be relevant
A comment must address something from the original post or be a follow-up to another comment that satisfies the rules.  If the topic is _global warming_ and you are posting about _socialism_ you might be on topic... but probably aren't.  It is up to the commenter to make the connection sufficiently clear.

### Be polite
You don't have to like everyone, but you must be _polite_.  This means you must refrain from personal attacks, even against people not on the thread.

### Be prepared to provide evidence
You don't have to provide citations for everything you write, but you should be prepared to provide evidence when asked.  Remember, not everyone agrees, but everyone who debates thinks their voice is worth something.  Because of this the burden of proof falls on every individual claim, even as simple as "that's not true".

### Admit when you are arguing from experience
To some degree all views are based on experience.  It is important to recognize this, and more important to accept that it won't change anyone's mind without additional reasoning.  Similarly, recognize when someone else is doing this as well and try to recognize that this experience will unreasonably add reassurance that are right.

### Strong man an opinion you don't agree with
Too many people try to argue what they *want* to argue agianst instead of arguing against what has been presented.  Verify you are understanding the topic being discussed by reiterating in your own words what they believe as if it is valid and correct.  Once both parties accept the statement, then it can be discussed without misunderstanding.
